colloqueer is an IRC client that can use colloquy themes. Right now it is
only tested with the Buttesfire theme. The Buttesfire theme works for the
most part, with a few minor tweaks to the css. Things will work much nicer
once certain features are added to the Gtk+ port of WebKit (specifically DOM
access.)

To run, simply edit config.yaml and run colloqueer.pl
